# Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) Arduino Project

This project demonstrates how energy can be harvested from organic waste using a Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), and how that energy can be monitored using an Arduino-based sensing and display system.

The system continuously monitors the voltage generated by the MFC using a voltage divider sensor module and displays the measured output on a 16x2 I2C LCD. Additionally, it provides a visual indication through an LED when the voltage exceeds a defined threshold, confirming microbial activity and power generation.

## Key Features

- Real-time voltage measurement from a Microbial Fuel Cell
- Threshold-based LED indication of electrical output
- Data display on a 16x2 I2C LCD
- Designed for low-power renewable energy monitoring applications

## Components Required

- Arduino UNO
- Voltage Sensor Module (0â€“25V)
- 16x2 LCD Display with I2C interface
- LED (with appropriate resistor)
- Microbial Fuel Cell setup with sludge or organic waste

## Circuit Connections

| Component         | Arduino Pin  |
|------------------|--------------|
| Voltage Sensor    | A0           |
| LED               | D9           |
| LCD SDA           | A4           |
| LCD SCL           | A5           |

## Usage Instructions

1. Connect all components according to the wiring table above.
2. Upload the `main.cpp` code to the Arduino UNO using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
3. Power the setup and monitor the LCD for real-time voltage output.
4. The LED will light up when the voltage exceeds 0.5V, indicating power is being generated by the MFC.

## Notes

- The voltage sensor uses a voltage divider circuit to scale down MFC output for safe analog input to Arduino.
- Voltage-to-ppm or calibration logic can be added if gas sensors are incorporated in future expansions.
