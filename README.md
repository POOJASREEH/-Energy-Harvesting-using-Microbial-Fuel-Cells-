# -Energy-Harvesting-using-Microbial-Fuel-Cells-
This project demonstrates sustainable electricity generation using Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs), converting organic and nitrogen-rich waste into power. An Arduino monitors the voltage in real time, while an LED provides a visual indicator. Perfect for students and researchers exploring green energy and bioelectrochemical systems.
